# Stateless OAuth2 Social Logins with Spring Boot

## Picking Social Providers

Choosing which social login providers to support will mostly depend on your target audience. For everyday folks, it will make sense to support providers like:

* Apple
* Google
* Twitter
* Facebook

Whereas for a more technical audience, it might make sense to support providers like:

* GitHub
* GitLab

Now, it's totally possible to register a new OAuth2 application via the developer portal of any of these providers. But for this project, I've decided to use an intermediary identity/authentication service called Auth0.

They've got some nice features where:

* they'll maintain a repository of all of your application's users
* they can offer different methods of authentication for your users (e.g.: social logins, traditional passwords)
* it's easy to start prototyping, because you can just toggle which social providers you'd like to enable


## Trouble Shooting

### Spring Boot cannot start, connect refused

Cannot put _localhost_ for *auth0.issuer-uri*

```
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.auth0.issuer-uri=https://dev-oopsmails.us.auth0.com/
```
### AUTH0: Callback URL not approved for this client application

Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59967302/callback-url-not-approved-for-this-client-application-approved-callback-urls-ca

You are most probably setting the twitter callback URL to your own domain, but in auth0 twitter login, the login callback should happen to auth0.

so change your **twitter** app callback URL to below,

https://your-tenant.auth0.com/login/callback

### Auth0: Authentication, Social, twitter

Try Connection, error,

```
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "You currently have Essential access which includes access to Twitter API v2 endpoints only. If you need access to this endpoint, youâ€™ll need to apply for Elevated access via the Developer Portal. You can learn more here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-leve"
}
```

Apply the Essential access, https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated

Works!

```
{
  "sub": "twitter|33333333",
  "nickname": "Albert",
  "name": "Albert",
  "picture": "https://abs.twimg.com/sticky/default_profile_images/default_profile_normal.png",
  "updated_at": "2022-09-09T16:13:33.969Z"
}
```

### Back in App, error,

```
Callback URL mismatch.
The provided redirect_uri is not in the list of allowed callback URLs.
Please go to the Application Settings page and make sure you are sending a valid callback url from your application.
```


go to auth0, Applications :: dev-app :: Settings

Allowed Callback URLs

```
http://localhost:8080/callback.html, https://www.google.ca
```
